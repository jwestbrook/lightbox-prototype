Lightbox for Prototype
======================

This script provides the lightbox functionality based on [Prototype Framework](https://github.com/sstephenson/prototype).

The development was inspired by the fact of absence lighbox-like script which will use Prototype + Scriptaculous libraries (Magento 1.x combination) and will work fine with all versions of major browsers (especially IEs). The 5 years old script by Justin Barkhuff. The slideshow functionality was stripped off to make a script as lighter as possible.

Bug reports, feature requests or contributions are highly appreciated.

Requirements
------------
- prototype.js 1.6.x.x or higher
- scriptaculous.js 1.7.1 or higher
- effects.js 1.7.1 or higher
